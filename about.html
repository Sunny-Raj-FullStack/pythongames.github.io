                Through this project you can enjoy playing games like Tik Tak Toe,Snake,Sudoku and Dots and Boxes altogether.
                Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an ` O' or an ` X' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner is the first player to get three of the same symbols in a row.
                In snake game,the player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.
                Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
                Dots and Boxes is a pencil-and-paper game for two players. It was first published in the 19th century by French mathematician Édouard Lucas, who called it la pipopipette. It has gone by many other names, including the dots and dashes, game of dots, dot to dot grid, boxes, and pigs in a pen. 
                Html,Css,Java script and Python are majorly used for making this project.
                The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
                Python provides a built-in library called pygame, which used to develop the game. Once we understand the basic concepts of Python programming, we can use the pygame library to make games with attractive graphics, suitable animation, and sound. Pygame is a cross-platform library that is used to design video games.
                Hope you will like the efforts we have put together.
